		Apple in September 2023 introduced the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, its new high-end flagship smartphones that are <br> being sold alongside the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. The iPhone 15 Pro models have an expanded feature set not available <br> in the standard iPhone 15 devices, including more advanced camera technology, a better display, a faster A17 chip, and more. </p>
	<p>
	Available in the <b> same 6.1 and 6.7-inch sizes </b> as the iPhone 14 Pro models, the iPhone 15 Pro models have a similar design, <br> but there are some notable changes. Rather than stainless steel, Apple is using a <b> frame made out of a new titanium alloy </b> that's also <br> used for spacecraft, and there are new titanium colors including <b> white, black, natural, </b> and <b> blue. </b> Titanium is lighter than stainless steel <br> so the <b> iPhone 15 Pro models weigh less </b> than the iPhone 14 Pro models
	<p>
	The titanium has a <b> new matte, brush texture </b> and it is accompanied by an <b> aluminum internal frame </b> that <b> improves thermal dissipation </b> <br> and the <b> repairability of the back glass. </b> Apple also tweaked the design, so the frame has <b> more contoured edges </b> and the <b> display bezels </b> are <b> <br> much thinner. </b> The front of the iPhone continues to be protected by Apple's <b> Ceramic Shield </b> material, which it says is the toughest glass used in a smartphone.
	<p>
	Apple is using the same <b> Super Retina XDR Display </b> from last year with <b> Always-On </b> display technology and a <b> 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate. </b> <br> The iPhone 15 Pro Max features a resolution of <b> 2796x1290</b>, while the iPhone 15 Pro has a resolution of <b> 2556x1179. </b> Aside from the slimmed down bezels, <br> there are no display changes, and it also features the same <b> Dynamic Island </b> at the top. 
	<p>
	Rather than a Lightning port, the iPhone 15 Pro models have a <b> USB-C port </b> that offers <b> USB 3 transfer speeds </b> up to <b> 10GB/s. </b> Charging is now done with a <br> USB-C cable, so you can use the same cord for charging the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. With the USB-C port, an iPhone can be used to <b> charge AirPods or an <br> Apple Watch directly. 15W Magsafe charging </b> continues to be available, and Apple added support for <b> Qi2 wireless charging. </b> 
	<p>
	There's a <b> customizable Action button </b> that's modeled after the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra, and it replaces the mute switch. It can be set to one of <br> multiple functions, such as <b> launching the camera, turning on Flashlight, recording a Voice Memo, </b> or <b> activating a Shortcut. </b> The Action button ties in with the <br> Dynamic Island for visual feedback that accompanies haptic feedback. 
	<p>
	An <b> upgrade 48-megapixel Main camera </b> offers improved low-light performance and a new <b> 24-megapixel default image </b> resolution that offers high-quality <br> images at a practical file size, an improvement over the prior 12-megapixel default. The main camera can be adjusted to <b> different focal lengths, </b> including <b> 24mm, 28mm, </b> <br> and <b> 35mm </b>, and there's an option to capture <b> 48-megapixel HEIF </b> images that take up less space than RAW images.
