<h1>LATEST IPHONE!<hr></hr></h1>
<h3>The iPhone 15 was announced at Apple's 12th September event.</h3>

<p><br>Apple CEO Tim Cook even paved the way for a price hike, hinting that the iPhone is now so essential to people's lives, that they're willing to pay even more than the current prices.</br>

<br>"The iPhone has become so integral into peopleâ€™s lives", Cook said on an earnings call to investors. "I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category."</br>

<br>Ultimately, the iPhone 15 proved a little more affordable than we thought, making up for the slight price hike we saw last year with the launch of the iPhone 14.</br></p><hr></hr>

<h2>Early Thoughts about Iphone 15</h2>
<p><br>So far, the iPhone 15 range looks impressive but it's fair to say that it will likely feel like an iterative rather than substantial update compared to the iPhone 14.</br>

<br>We're excited about the AV1 technology and how it'll impact video quality from streaming services on the Pro models, and USB-C is certainly a change that we agree with long-term.

</br><br>Last year we gave the iPhone 14 Pro Max our What Hi-Fi? Award for best premium smartphone. Will this year's range still prove to be the ones to beat? Look out for our full reviews coming soon.</br>
