	<h4>There are four models in the iPhone 15 generation.</h4>
	
	<p>There are four models in the iPhone 15 generation <em><b>the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.</b></em><br>There's no iPhone 15 Mini, like there was with the iPhone 13 generation — Apple discontinued its iPhone Mini model in the iPhone 14 generation.
	<br>Likewise, there's no iPhone 15 "Ultra" model with extended upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which earlier reports suggested might be announced during Apple's September event.</br>
	CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, featuring an industry-first color-infused <strong>back glass with a stunning, textured matte finish, and a new contoured edge on the aluminum enclosure.</strong> Both models feature the Dynamic Island, and an advanced camera system designed to help users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives. A powerful 48MP Main camera enables super-high-resolution photos and a new 2x Telephoto option to give users a total of three optical zoom levels — like having a third camera. The iPhone 15 lineup also introduces the next generation of portraits, making it easier to capture portraits with great detail and low-light performance. Building on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure, Roadside Assistance via satellite can connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while off the grid. With A16 Bionic for powerful, proven performance; a USB‑C connector; Precision Finding for Find My friends; and industry-leading durability features, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus represent a huge leap forward.
	iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus represent a huge leap forward with exciting camera innovations that inspire creativity, the intuitive Dynamic Island, and features like Roadside Assistance via satellite that make a real difference in users’ lives,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We’re also pushing the power of computational photography to new levels this year with a 48MP Main camera featuring a new 24MP default for super-high-resolution photos, a new 2x Telephoto option, and next-generation portraits.</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Release Date</h1>
	<p> While Apple announced the iPhone 15 generation on <b>September 12, 2023,</b> preorders for the iPhone 15 models and iPhone 15 Pro models start at 8 am ET on September 15 from Apple and carriers like AT&T and Verizon. The phones will release on September 22 at Apple and other retailers.</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Price</h1>
	<p>Save for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPhone 15 generation is priced the same as the iPhone 14 generation at launch.The iPhone 15 Pro Max starts with 256GB of storage instead of the 128GB option from the iPhone 14 Pro Max, increasing the base model pricing by $100 to $1,199, instead of $1,099.</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Cameras</h1>
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/huawei/OneDrive/Desktop/Dinglasan/dinglasancamera.jpg" alt="dinglasancamera">
	<h4>Only the iPhone 15 Pro Max gets the new 5x “tetraprism” zoom lens.</h4>
	<p>Apple introduced major camera upgrades on all the iPhone 15 models. The main cameras on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are bumped up from 12 megapixels (MP) to 48MP. The new camera offers optical quality (versus inferior digital) 2x zoom by cropping the middle 12MP of the 48MP sensor. That's a meaningful new option in Apple's iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.Photos taken with the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are binned from 48MP to 24MP by default, which should add extra detail and clarity. Despite more megapixels, Apple says 24MP photos are still stored at a "practical file size," but we don't yet know how much storage a photo uses, whether it's smaller or larger than 12MP (likely larger).The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also have a 48MP main camera that takes 24MP photos, and Apple added popular 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths as preset options.The iPhone 15 Pro comes with the typical 3x zoom lens, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is furnished with Apple's new 5x zoom lens with a 120mm focal length. The new 5x zoom lens is similar to the periscope-style 10x zoom lens on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, but Apple calls it a "tetraprism" design.Later in 2023, Apple will deliver spatial video recording to the iPhone 15 Pro models to capture video in 3D for the Apple Vision Pro AR headset, which is being released "early next year."</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Design</h1>
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/huawei/OneDrive/Desktop/Dinglasan/dinglasandesign.jpg" alt="dinglasandesign">
	<h4>All iPhone 15 models get Apple's latest contoured edge design.</h4>
	<p>All iPhone 15 models received Apple's latest design with softer contoured edges compared to the sharper edges on the iPhone 14 generation. The contoured edges should make the iPhone 15 generation more comfortable to hold, overall.A Titanium frame with a brushed metal aesthetic replaces shiny polished steel on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, which makes for a lighter weight overall. Indeed, the iPhone 15 Pro is 6.6 ounces compared to the 7.27-ounce iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 7.81 ounces compared to the heavy 8.47-ounce iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/huawei/OneDrive/Desktop/Dinglasan/dinglasandesign2.jpg" alt="dinglasandesign2">
	<h4>The iPhone 15 Pro models have thinner display bezels and a titanium frame.</h4>
	<p> The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also feature <q><em><b>thinner display bezels that make for a more premium look</b>
	
	</em></q>. They're also easier, and likely cheaper, to repair than previous iPhone Pro models thanks to the glass back that's more easily removed.</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Battery Life</h1>
	<p> Apple spent no time talking about specifics related to battery life for the iPhone 15 generation, as there's no claimed improvement here at all for any of the iPhone 15 models — we can expect similar battery life to the iPhone 14 generation, which was generally excellent. The iPhone 14 Plus especially wowed us and still holds the best result out of any phone in our battery test.</p>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Display</h1>
	<p>Apple made no changes to its usual display size on the iPhone 15 generation. However, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus received updated displays with a brighter 2000 nits compared to the 1200-nit iPhone 14 display. </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>iPhone 15: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, 60Hz</li>
	<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display, 60Hz</li>
	<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz ProMotion, always-on display</li>
	<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz ProMotion, always-on display</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Performance</h1>
	<p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus run on the same A16 Bionic processor from the iPhone 14 Pro series, so we can expect similar performance to last year's high-end phones. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max run on Apple's latest A17 Pro processor. Apple claims the A17 Pro has a <q>10 percent faster CPU</q> and <q>20 percent faster</q> GPU (graphics), but it's unclear what the company is making comparisons with.Apple placed heavy emphasis on smoother graphics and gaming performance with hardware-accelerated ray tracing (a method of generating impressive lighting effects) thanks to the A17 Pro processor on the iPhone 15 Pro models. The company touted that full console titles can run on the iPhone 15 Pro models, like <q>Resident Evil Village</q> <q>Resident Evil 4</q>,<q>Death Stranding</q>,<q>and "Assassin's Creed Mirage.</q>
	
	<h1>iPhone 15: Colors</h1>
	<img src="file:///C:/Users/huawei/OneDrive/Desktop/Dinglasan/dinglasancolors.jpg" alt="dinglasancolors">
	<h4>The standard iPhone 15 series is available in five colors. </h4>
	<p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature Apple's new color-infused back glass with a frosted matte texture available in five color options,<strong>including blue, pink, yellow, green, and black.</strong></p>
	
	<h1>Should you buy an iPhone 15?</h1>
	<p>The iPhone 15 series offers a slate of upgrades and new features that may well be worth your money, depending on your priorities and on which phone you're upgrading from. Upgrading to the iPhone 15 generation for any specific new feature, no matter how small, is less costly and easier than ever. Apple and carriers offer excellent trade-in offers depending on your existing iPhone's age and condition, and if you can swap your old phone and get the new one for free or at a significant discount, it's tough to argue against upgrading to the iPhone 15 series.Before even handling the iPhone 15 models ourselves, we can say the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus' cameras are a major upgrade, especially the new ability to use the 48MP sensor as a 12MP 2x optical zoom lens. That adds meaningful versatility while maintaining high photo quality. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's 5x "tetraprism" zoom lens needs a closer look before any final judgments, but if you've ever wished you could take better photos of far-away subjects, it's certainly worth considering an upgrade. The lighter titanium frame is a worthwhile evolution for the iPhone 15 Pro models — I've always said the iPhone 14 Pro series, especially the iPhone 14 Pro Max, is ridiculously heavy for a daily device. Apple's latest contoured edge design is also tempting, as I find the sharper design kicked off by the iPhone 12 through to the iPhone 14 to be actively uncomfortable.USB-C on the iPhone 15 generation is certainly a welcome addition, as it lets you charge your phone with the same cable as your Mac, iPad (if they're USB-C models, too), and any other device that uses USB-C for charging. However, since iPhone users already have Lightning cables, we wouldn't say it's a feature that's worth an urgent upgrade. 
	We can say for sure that if you own an iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or any iPhone model from before 2017, you'll want to seriously consider upgrading to a newer iPhone, whether it's the iPhone 15, iPhone 14, or iPhone 13 generations that Apple offers. It's worth noting that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus received a $100 price drop for new $699 and $799 starting prices, respectively. The iPhone 13 was also reduced a further $100, bringing its starting price down to $599. Apple's iPhones are historically solid, save for odd software bugs that are often addressed in software updates — you generally know you're going to get a reliable phone, and the iPhone 15 series should be no exception.</p>
