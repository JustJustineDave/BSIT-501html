		<h3>IPHONE 15: THE OFFICIAL FEAUTURES</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The 6.1-inch iPhone 15 (from $799) and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus (from $899) 
				gets the Dynamic Island, previously a feature 
				exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro. This allows you to see alerts and live activities more easily.</li>
				<li>The display has now been cranked up to 2,000 
				nits of brightness in direct sunlight, twice what the iPhone 14 could manage.</li>
				<li>Apple's made the back glass panel a single colored 
				piece of material. It's also got a slight contour for a softer feel in-hand.</li>
				<li>The available colors are pink, yellow, blue, black and green.</li>
				<li>More recycled materials are present in the iPhone 15, 
				including 100% recycled cobalt in the battery and 75% recycled aluminum in the frame.</li>
				<li>Apple's upgraded the main camera to a 48MP unit, which will help take more detail or brighter 
				shots as you need. It can shoots 24MP images instead of just 
				12MP, and can zoom in at 2x magnification without losing sharpness.</li>
				<li>Portrait mode in the camera has been upgraded so it can be enabled during 
				or after taking photos, or let you switch subjects when editing. There are now 
				dedicated controls for focus and depth, smarter HDR colors, and skin tones are more "true to life."</li>
				<li>Running the show is the A16 Bionic chip from the 
				iPhone 14 Pro, offering greater CPU, GPU and ML performance.</li>
				<li>Apple promises "all-day battery life", but the iPhone 
				15 Plus will last longer thanks to its larger overall battery.</li>
				<li>iPhone 15's ultra wideband capabilities have improved, offering connections 
				from three times as far. You can use it find a friend's location through Find My by using it.</li>
				<li>Your voice should be clearer on iPhone 15 calls thanks to machine learning improvements. 
				You can also enable a Voice Isolation mode to cut out more external noise.</li>
				<li>Emergency SOS via Satellite now can be used to summon roadside assistance 
				(currently from AAA in the U.S.) even if you're away from a cell signal. 
				This and Emergency SOS are available for free for two years.</li>
				<li>The Lightning connector has gone, with the iPhone 15 using USB-C for charging, data transfer and more. 
				You can charge an Apple Watch or new pair of AirPods Pro from your iPhone with a USB-C cable too.</li>
				<li>Apple's not offering leather accessories, instead introducing a FineWoven alternative.</li>

		<h3>IPHONE 15: RELEASE DATE AND PRICE</h3>
			<p>iPhone 15 preorders are underway, and the best iPhone 15 deals can help you save money on your new phone. 
			All four iPhone 15 models hit stores on Friday, September 22.</p>
			
			<p>For pricing, you'll pay at least $799 for the iPhone 15, and $899 for the iPhone 15 Plus. That's the 
			same pricing as last year's iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, so good news for users who already find this price high enough.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: DESIGN</h3>
			<p>You've got a choice of four iPhone 15 models, like with previous iPhone launches. 
			There's the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus, which offer a basic flagship 
			level of specs, then the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max which offer 
			Apple's best tech, for some extra money of course. Sadly, the iPhone mini model remains dead, 
			with the iPhone 13 mini also being discontinued as part of Apple's device refresh.</p>
			
			<p>If you've been following the rumors, you may have noticed we've got an iPhone 15 Pro Max, 
			not an iPhone 15 Ultra. This was rumored to be the name of the phone for several months, 
			but Apple's sticking with its current naming scheme for at least the next year.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 1.jpg" alt="IPHONE 1">
			
			<p>The iPhone 15 still looks like the past few generations of iPhone, but it'll 
			likely feel different to hold because of rounded edges on the back and front. 
			It's also got a slightly different look on the back, with the glass getting a 
			matte finish with the color applied all the way through the panel. The aluminum 
			side rails and IP68 dust water resistance ratings have been passed down from 
			the iPhone 14 to the new models also.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 2.jpg" alt="IPHONE 2">
			
			<p>Apple's offering a range of five colors for the standard iPhone 15 and 
			iPhone 15 Plus: black, green, blue, yellow and pink.</p>
			
			<p>If you're interested in Apple's eco credentials, then the iPhone 15 is promised 
			to use 100% recycled cobalt in its battery, and 75% recycled aluminum in its frame.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: DISPLAY AND DYNAMIC ISLAND</h3>
			<p>The Dynamic Island that debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro is now present on all iPhone 
			15 models, giving users a few extra display pixels compared to notched iPhones of the 
			same size, plus the fun of using the adaptive widgets unique to the Island.</p>
			
			<p>The screen itself has had its brightness boosted, with a rated maximum of 1,600 nits 
			HDR brightness, and 2,000 nits when outdoors according to Apple. That should make it far 
			easier to use the phone in direct sunlight.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: USB-C</h3>
			<p>Perhaps the largest change to the iPhone 15 is the addition of a USB-C port. Gone 
			is the familiar Lightning connector, and in its place we have the more universal 
			USB-C that iPads, Macs and Android phones have been using for several years. It'll 
			mean you need to trade out your existing iPhone cables if you're not already using 
			another device with USB-C.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 3.jpg" alt="IPHONE 3">
			
			<p>There's a slight difference between the USB-C used on the standard iPhone 15 and 
			the iPhone 15 Pro. As befits its Pro title, the iPhone 15 Pro can transfer data at 
			a higher speed (up to 10 Gbps, to be exact).</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to the new port, you can also charge accessories, like an Apple Watch or 
			AirPods Pro with the new USB-C charging case, by plugging it into the iPhone 15.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: CAMERAS</h3>
			<p>Apple's given all iPhone 15 models a 48MP main camera, rather than just the Pros. 
			The 48MP sensor on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus is different than the one 
			used by the Pro models though.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 4.jpg" alt="IPHONE 4">
			
			<p>Instead of shooting in 12MP resolution with a simple 1x magnification like before, 
			the new camera now offers a 24MP mode that allows you to prioritize detail, and a 2x 
			lossless zoom mode that gives you some of the benefits of having a telephoto camera 
			like the iPhone 15 Pro has.</p>
			
			<p>There's been no change to the selfie or ultrawide cameras, but software-level changes, 
			like improved HDR and skin color accuracy, will still make shooting with these sensors better. 
			The familiar Portrait mode has been made smarter too, with it now automatically enabling when 
			it detects a suitable subject, and letting you adjust its focus and depth while you take 
			the shot or when editing it afterward.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 5.jpg" alt="IPHONE 5">
			
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: PERFORMANCE</h3>
			<p>The basic iPhone 15 has adopted last year's Pro model's chipset: the A16 Bionic chipset. 
			This gives the phones enhanced performance across CPU, GPU and machine learning benchmarks.</p>
			
			<p>Apple's promising all-day battery life once again for the iPhone 15 series, although we're 
			sure that our custom TG battery test will reveal differences between the different models. 
			Apple itself admitted that the iPhone 15 Plus, with its larger battery, lasts longer than the 
			standard iPhone 15, meaning it could be the choice for users who are often running out of charge.</p>
			
			<p>Charging speeds haven't changed despite the new charging ports, so don't expect super speedy 
			charging from any of the new iPhones. But at least wireless charging is now at 15W whether you're 
			using MagSafe or a third-party Qi2 charger.</p>
			
			<p>Storage options haven't changed from previous years, meaning you get 128GB storage by default 
			on either the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, or can spend more to get 256GB or 512GB on-board instead.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: SOFTWARE AND SPECIAL FEATURES</h3>
			<p>All of the iPhone 15 models will run iOS 17 out of the box. This will roll out to other recent iPhones 
			on September 18, so don't upgrade just for the new software features like StandBy mode.</p>
			
			<p>Unique to the iPhone 15 however is enhanced ultra wideband connectivity, allowing you to use Precision 
			Finding mode to locate lost objects (or your friend's location) from up to three times further away. </p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 6.jpg" alt="IPHONE 6">
			
			<p>Emergency SOS via Satellite has also been enhanced with a roadside assistance mode that will allow users
			to summon the AAA to their location, even if you're outside of cell range and not already a member 
			(though there will be a per-use fee). You get this for two years for free with an iPhone 15 purchase, 
			with Apple not telling us what it'll charge for these features when the two years are up.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 7.jpg" alt="IPHONE 7">
			
			<p>Apple's also using new machine learning system to help you sound clearer on phone calls. The iPhone 15 
			offers an even more powerful Voice Isolation mode if you need it as well, cutting out more background noise.</p>
	<hr>
		<h3>IPHONE 15: OUTLOOK</h3>
			<p>We get why people will be especially excited for the Pro iPhone models, but there's been enough overall 
			improvement to the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus' specs that they look like phones you may still want to consider.</p>
			
			<img src="/IPHONE 8.jpg" alt="IPHONE 8">
			
			<p>For one, the price remains the same as last year, except now you get a comfier design, a Dynamic Island camera 
			cutout, a 48MP camera on the back (with 24MP photos and 2x lossless zoom) plus USB-C charging. That's quite a 
			few extra toys on top of the iPhone 14.</p>
			
			<p>We'll be going hands-on with the iPhone 15 series soon enough, and we can't wait to tell you what it's like 
			to use. And stay tuned for our eventual review too, where we can give you an ultimate verdict on whether the 
			iPhone 15 is worthy of becoming your next smartphone.</p>
