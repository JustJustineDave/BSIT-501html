<h2>Reasons many are excited about the iPhone 15.</h2>
<h3> 4 reasons I am more excited about the regular iPhone 15 than the Pro models </h3>
<hr>
<h3> 1. The addition of the Dynamic Island.</h3>
<p>The regular iPhone 15 models might not get a titanium frame or slimmer bezels,<br>
 if the rumors are any indication, but they're expected to ditch the notch in favor of the Dynamic Island.
 This pill-shaped cutout,<br> which was introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro models last year,<br>
 works with iOS software to change the shape and size to display alerts and notifications.<br> And now,
 it's set to make its debut on the regular and Plus models.

 <h3>2. The same USB-C treatment</h3>
 <p>You may have heard rumors about Apple finally adopting the USB-C port for charging on the upcoming iPhone,<br> 
 but did you know that applies to the regular and Plus iPhone 15 variants?<br> The Lightning connector has been around for years and is starting to show its age,<br>
 so this is going to be a nice change as Apple finally catches up with the rest of the industry.</p>

 <h3>3. The mute switch is here to stay</h3>
 <p>Apple is reportedly planning to replace the physical mute switch on current iPhones<br>
 with an Action button similar to the one on the Apple Watch Ultra. This button is set to give users instant access to a variety of quick actions,<br> 
 allowing them to access things like the Accessibility menu, Shortcuts, the flashlight, voice memos, and more, without having to unlock their phone.<br>
 I'm not against the idea of having a universal button on the iPhone that lets me access some of my most used functions,<br>
 but I'm not happy about it replacing the iconic tiny toggle, which I also want more Android phones to adopt.</p>
 
 <hr>
 <h3>4.Battery improvements</h3>
 <p>It remains to be seen how big the batteries will be, how much they'll benefit the users, or even if the rumors are true,<br>
 but any improvement will be a piece of welcome news for the iPhone 15 models, especially the smaller ones.<br>
 I won't put my money on charging improvements despite the switch to USB-C because rumor has it that only the Pro models are expected to see an increase to either 27W or 33W.</p>
